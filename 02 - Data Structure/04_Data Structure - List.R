#LIST: It may contain a combinaton of vectors, matrices, data frames and even other list # nolint

# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10

# First 3 rows of the built-in data frame mtcars

# Construct list with these different elements:
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)

# give name using name ()
names(my_list) <- c("vec", "mat", "df")

# Print out my_list
